## Code challenges
It's the collection of my code exercises which I did in the past first I will focus on Python


The challenges are splatted between two platform LeetCode and CodeWars 
and on each of them you will find the dir with challenge name, 
* QUESTION.md - with description of exercise.
* solution.py - with my solution 
* test_solution.py with with runnable test case
* pipfile - with all packages used
* platform_result folder - with image screenshot which describe about runtime and memory 
distribution based on all submission


##### launch tests
go to Challenge dir e.g Max Consecutive Ones

```
# To install env with packages
pipenv install 

# To remove env after testing
pipenv --rm

# To run all TC
pipenv run py -m unittest
```


##### required
* python 3.7
* pipenv

##### Worth to check
* LeetCode
    * Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
    [runtime beats 95.94% then rest submissions]
    * Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 
    [runtime beats 95.85% then rest submissions]
    * Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side
    [one liner ;) but take too much time ;(]
